# Fallout Terminal

## Description

This program is supposed to emulate the "Fallout" terminal that can be found in fallout 4/ fallout new vegas.
User should be able to choose their difficulty, and "hack" into the terminal by selecting the correct password

### Inspiration
The fallout series, more specifically Fallout 3, New Vegas, and 4 is my favorite open world series.
I am a fan of the terminal hacks required in the game that are involved with several missions.
Creating a replica of the Fallout terminal will be both challenging and exciting for me to get more familiar with different libraries in python

### Running Program
As of right now, in it's simplest form you will run the program with
```
python3 app/password_guess.py --difficulty {difficulty_level}
```
