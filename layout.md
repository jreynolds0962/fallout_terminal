1. Create a word library
    - Create different libraries of specific word lengths 
    - Ex. library where all words are 4 letters, another where all are 6 letters



2. Randomly select 10 words from single library
    - Have a "answer" that is randomly selected from those five words
        - use random module to pick out 10 unique lines from the file
        - use set to make sure values are unique


4. Let a user select any word from the randomly selected list
    - create menu style layout with cursers library
    - 


5. If the selection is correct "let them in"
6. If the selection is incorrect, lose 1 try and allow the user to select a word again
    - Let the user select a word until all 3 uses are up
    - Make it to where User can only guess the items in the list (if guess not in list, try again)
    - Take out a guess from list if already tried that word
    
8. Add arguments to the cli command
